# Professional Portfolio Website

## Description

This website is intended to be my professional portfolio. 

There are a few interact parts of this website. If you click on any of the three sections listed in the nav bar, you will be brought to the corresponding section of the page. If you click any of the images in the "Projects" section, a new tab will open in your browser, bringing you to the project's deployed website. If you click on my email address, it will open up your email service, and start an email addressed to me. And lastly, if you click on "Github" at the bottom of the page, you will be brought to my Github profile.

## Tasks

I began this project without any starter code. I designed the HTML from the ground up, as well as the CSS. Getting my HTML setup was the fastest part of this. By far, I spent the most time using CSS to get the page formatted the way I wanted it. The rest of the project wasn't terribly challenging. Turning images into links, having the nav bar bring you to different sections, creating text links. I found those goals to be fairly simple. My biggest hurdle was formatting, formatting, formatting!

## What I Learned

I learned A LOT during this project. The main thing I learned is the importance of keeping track of which container each element is in. A lot of time can be wasted adding attributes to the wrong section. Some things need to be applied to child elements, while others need to be applied to parent elements, and knowing the difference will save a lot of frustration. 

I also learned that anchor tags can really muddle things up. The solution seems to be wrapping anchor tags in a div. Before doing that, my images would not scale as the screen got smaller, and they would not fall into the grids that I wanted them too. 

Lastly, I learned that sometimes, you just need to step away for a little bit!
